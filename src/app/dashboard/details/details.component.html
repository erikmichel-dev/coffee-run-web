      <h1>Welcome to the Coffee Card Brewer</h1>
      <p>A straightforward web page featuring a single, unique feature: brew a random coffee card from a collection of
        one hundred different cards. Each card is ranked within five distinct tiers, showcasing multiple origins.
        Originally conceived as a card collector game, it has been streamlined to focus on learning new concepts and
        avoid repetitive tasks.</p>

      <h3>What was learned then?</h3>
      <p>The primary objective of this project was to gain proficiency in Terraform and GitHub Actions. Leveraging AWS
        services, the project stores cards in DynamoDB.
        Brewer requests are handled through a REST API with API Gateway and managed by a Lambda function.
        Additionally, the Angular-based website is hosted on an S3 Bucket and accessed via a CloudFront distribution
        with Origin Access Control (OAC).<br>
        Both the Angular and Terraform projects undergo automated building and deployment via GitHub Actions
        pipelines.</p>
